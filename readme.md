## Simple Blazor TODO

This repository is a tryout to see the power and simplicity of blazor.
To see how it compares to PHP Laravel's Livewire and filament tooling.
And to revive my own .NET experience.

Idea's:
- Build a simple TODO list (add, remove, check-of)
  - Make multiple lists
- Tryout TabBlazer as admin tooling.
